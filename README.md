# Simple-MNIST-Neural-Network-Model

This project provides a simple demo on how to create a neural network model to classify MNIST datasets using TensorFlow. It includes code for preprocessing the data, building and training the neural network model, and evaluating its performance. The model achieves high accuracy on the MNIST test dataset and includes visualizations such as confusion matrices to analyze its performance.
